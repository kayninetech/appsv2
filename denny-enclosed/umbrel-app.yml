  Enclosed is a minimalist web application designed for securely sending private notes. Whether you're sharing sensitive information or simply need a straightforward way to send encrypted messages, Enclosed offers an easy-to-use interface with robust security features, ensuring that your data remains confidential.


  Enclosed uses native browser cryptographic APIs to encrypt and decrypt notes, providing both security and high performance. These APIs are only accessible in secure contexts (HTTPS), so if you're running the app over an insecure connection (HTTP), you’ll see a warning in the app.


  ⚠️ For HTTPS setup, you can use the Cloudflare Tunnel app available in the Umbrel App Store to secure your connection.
