 ✏️ Excalidraw is a web-based, open-source tool for creating hand-drawn-style diagrams, sketches, and illustrations.

  
  It allows users to quickly draw shapes, text, and arrows with a simple, intuitive interface that mimics the look of freehand sketches. 
  Popular for brainstorming, flowcharts, wireframes, and collaborative whiteboard sessions, Excalidraw also supports real-time collaboration, enabling multiple users to draw together on the same canvas.
