  🚨 Alerting: Grafana provides robust alerting capabilities that notify users of potential issues in their data. Alerts can be configured based on specific conditions, and notifications can be sent via email, Slack, PagerDuty, and other channels.


  🧩 Templating: Users can create reusable templates to filter and manipulate data dynamically. This feature is particularly useful for creating dashboards that need to display information for multiple entities or environments.


  📌 Annotations: Grafana allows users to add annotations to graphs, providing context for specific events or changes in data. This feature helps teams understand the impact of deployments, incidents, or other significant events.
