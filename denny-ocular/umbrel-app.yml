releaseNotes: >-
  The latest update introduces several new features, including support for Brazilian Portuguese and Turkish languages, an expanded list of currencies, and a fix to prevent dialogs from blocking password managers. Bug fixes include synchronizing the locale with the browser's locale, correcting the currency synchronization with internationalization (i18n), and ensuring the CellMenu functions properly on Safari and Firefox.


  In terms of refactoring, the click listener has been moved to the button in the ContextMenu, and number formats have been removed from the internationalization files. Additionally, various chores were addressed, such as updating the project to pnpm v9, adding a code owners file, freezing dependencies in CI, configuring the main workflow to run on pushes and pull requests, and adding issue and pull request templates. 
  
  
  The project dependencies have been updated, and the .env.genesis variables have also been modified.
