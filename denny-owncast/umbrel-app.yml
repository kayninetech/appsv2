releaseNotes: >-
    In the latest update, several enhancements and fixes have been introduced to improve functionality and user experience. Notably, the addition of sanitization for Fediverse usernames and the specification of content types for custom JavaScript significantly enhance system integrity and performance. The "rel-me" attribute has also been added to the server-rendered bot/metadata/search page template, contributing to better SEO practices.

    Key changes include preventing duplicate join chat events for users already in the chat and ensuring that chat messages and state changes are read aloud in the ARIA live region for improved accessibility. Additionally, chat moderators are now exempt from message rate limiting, and the design for offline video embeds has been improved.

    Several bugs have been addressed, including issues with horizontal scrolling on narrower screens, concurrency errors, and inconsistencies in thumbnail generation when using S3. The player timestamp bug and pagination problems in the 'Followers' console have also been resolved, alongside fixes for webhook creation and mobile chat button display issues.

    Finally, the update removes Matrix URL validation, allowing greater flexibility in URL usage.
