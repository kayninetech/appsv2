releaseNotes: >-
  A new configuration option, DEFAULT_BOARD, has been added. This allows administrators to define a default board that will automatically load when users visit the site. This feature is designed to streamline collaboration by directing users to a pre-set board without requiring manual selection, ensuring a consistent entry point for group activities. This change improves user experience and simplifies navigation to frequently used boards.
